# ResumeOS Current Context

## Current Milestone

Active milestone:

- Editor enhancement: Vim mode

## Completed Milestones

- project architecture and production planning documented
- Section 1: resume document core scaffolded and verified
- Section 2A: compile contract and editor workspace scaffolded and verified
- Section 2B: real TeX compile execution and PDF preview implemented and verified
- Section 2C: Monaco integration and compile test hardening implemented and verified
- Section 5: patch-set workflow completed and merged into `main`
- Section 6: style memory completed and merged into `main`
- Section 4: protected document model and safe suggestion workflow completed and merged into `main`

## Current Constraints

- AI features remain deferred until the editor and compile foundation is solid
- local dev persistence is SQLite for now
- browser port binding is restricted in the current sandbox, so frontend verification relies on production builds
- compile behavior should preserve the existing API contract introduced in Section 2A

## Current Backend Reality

- backend stack: FastAPI
- active compile route: `POST /resumes/{resume_id}/compile`
- compile runs are persisted in `compile_runs`
- current compile implementation uses real `latexmk` execution and stores generated PDF artifacts locally

## Current Frontend Reality

- editor page is a two-pane workspace
- left pane: Monaco-based LaTeX editor
- right pane: compile status, real PDF preview, snapshots, document model summary, and suggestion review
- the review surface now speaks in terms of patch sets instead of generic suggestions
- the workspace now also includes a first tailoring input for job descriptions
- tailoring now creates a pre-tailor snapshot before suggestions are generated
- dirty-state tracking now follows the last saved draft

## Immediate Next Goal

Add the first editor preference enhancement: a standard/Vim mode toggle for the Monaco-based LaTeX editor.

That means:

- integrate Vim keybindings into Monaco
- expose a simple mode toggle in the editor workspace
- keep standard mode as the default

## Definition of Success for the Current Slice

- the user can toggle between standard and Vim modes in the editor
- standard mode remains unchanged by default
- Vim mode provides active keybindings and visible mode feedback
- the chosen editor mode now persists across reloads in the browser
- frontend production build passes
- backend regression tests still pass after the editor-only change

## Known Risks

- local TeX tooling may differ from the intended production container
- compile subprocesses need timeouts and temp-directory isolation
- PDF serving needs a clean local artifact strategy before later migration to object storage
- the current document-model parser is heuristic and intentionally conservative
- Vim integration may require a frontend dependency and careful client-only setup
